# Next.js Starter Template

> This is a Next.js starter templated used to create a new Next.js project with some pre-configured settings.

## Motivation

I created this template to avoid setting up the same configurations every time I start a new Next.js project. This template includes some pre-configured settings that I use in my projects. As such, it may not be suitable for everyone. However, you can always modify the configurations to suit your needs.
